What you should learn from this project:

What is a dynamic library, how does it work, how to create one, and how to use it
What is the environment variable $LD_LIBRARY_PATH and how to use it
What are the differences between static and shared libraries
Basic usage nm, ldd, ldconfig
Create a Dynamic libray
You must make Position Independent object Code, and dynamic libraries end with .so:

gcc -fPIC *.c -shared -o libholberton.so
There are a couple relevant flags to note:

-fPIC: Creates Position Independent Code, which is required when generating dynamic libraries because they are implemented at runtime, the library could be loaded anywhere in memory.
-shared: Creates a shared (dynamic) library, which is similar to a normal executable with a few exceptions. The significant difference is executables have one entry point. Where as dynamic libraries have no defined entry point, they can have multiple entry points.
0. A library is not a luxury but one of the necessities of life
Create the dynamic library libholberton.so containing all the functions listed below:
1. Without libraries what have we? We have no past and no future
Create a script that creates a dynamic library called liball.so from all the .c files that are in the current directory.
2. Either write something worth reading or do something worth writing
Write a blog post describing the differences between static and dynamic libraries. It should cover:
3. Let's call C functions from Python
I know, you’re missing C when coding in Python. So let’s fix that!
